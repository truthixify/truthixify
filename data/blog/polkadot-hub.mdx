## Introduction: A New Chapter for Polkadot

Polkadot has long been the ‚Äúparachain network,‚Äù where teams crafted unique blockchains. Now, with **Polkadot 2.0**, a leap toward elastic computation and optional parachains, developers can deploy smart contracts directly on **Polkadot Hub**, the central platform for smart-contract innovation in the Polkadot 2.0 era. Follow along to explore what **Polkadot Hub** is, why it exists, what you can build, and how it shapes Polkadot‚Äôs multichain future.

---

## Background: From Parachains to Polkadot 2.0

Polkadot 1.0 relied on parachains, secured through slot auctions and crowdloans, a process requiring heavy engineering and costs. **Polkadot 2.0**, launched in 2024, introduces **elastic scaling**, **asynchronous backing** (validating multiple blocks in parallel for higher throughput), and **agile coretime** (renting compute slots dynamically). This toolkit-like approach makes Polkadot more accessible, setting the stage for **Polkadot Hub**. Here‚Äôs the shift:

| Era | Focus | Developer Entry | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | Parachains | Heavy runtime engineering | High (slot leasing) |
| 2.0 | Smart contracts (Hub) | Deploy via rEVM / PVM | Low (pay-as-you-go) |

This evolution opens new doors. **Polkadot Hub** emerges as the heart of this transformation.

## What Is Polkadot Hub?

Imagine a vibrant marketplace where developers craft apps that connect across Polkadot‚Äôs ecosystem. **Polkadot Hub**, built by [Parity Technologies](https://www.parity.io/), is a smart-contract-centric system parachain, unifying **rEVM** and **PVM** in a shared execution layer secured by the relay chain. Unlike standalone parachains, developers deploy contracts without maintaining runtimes. Here‚Äôs what powers it:

- **Dual smart-contract environments**:  
  - **rEVM**: Ethereum-compatible for **Solidity** developers.  
  - **PVM**: **Polkadot Virtual Machine**, powered by RISC-V.  
- Native **XCM** connectivity to all parachains.  
- Shared security via Polkadot‚Äôs relay chain.  
- **DOT**-based gas and **OpenGov** governance.

*Analogy*: If parachains are specialty shops, **Polkadot Hub** is the central plaza where goods and services flow seamlessly. Let‚Äôs explore its technical foundation.

## Architectural Overview

**Polkadot Hub**‚Äôs architecture powers its multichain vision. Here are the components driving it:

### **Core Components**

1. **rEVM Environment**  
   - Executes **Solidity** bytecode via a runtime-level EVM module.  
   - Supports Hardhat, Foundry, MetaMask.  
   - Ideal for porting existing dApps.

2. **PVM Environment**  
   - Built on [PolkaVM‚Äôs RISC-V architecture](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/polkavm-design/) for gas-efficient execution.  
   - Supports **Rust** via **ink!**, with plans for C and AssemblyScript bindings.  
   - Aligns with Polkadot‚Äôs native runtime for sustainability.

3. **Cross-Consensus Layer (XCM)**  
   - **rEVM** and **PVM** expose **XCM** APIs natively, enabling direct cross-chain messages without relayers.  
   - Supports **XCM** v3+ for advanced operations.

4. **Hub Runtime**  
   - Manages **DOT** payments, storage rent, and **OpenGov** integration.

### **Dual-VM Design**

Together, these components form the dual-VM foundation of **Polkadot Hub**:

| Feature | rEVM | PVM |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | **Solidity** | **Rust**/C/Any ‚Üí RISC-V |
| Compatibility | Ethereum | Polkadot-native |
| Execution | Stack machine | Register-based |
| Goal | Portability | Performance & composability |

This design fuels **Polkadot Hub**‚Äôs mission. Let‚Äôs see why it‚Äôs a game-changer.

## Why the Hub Exists

**Polkadot Hub** simplifies Web3 development by removing parachain complexity, welcoming **EVM** developers with **rEVM**, and offering a runtime that leverages Polkadot‚Äôs scalability, security, and cross-chain messaging. Unlike [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/news/differentiating-polkadot-hub-and-moonbeam/), a parachain focused on **EVM**, **Polkadot Hub** integrates **rEVM** and **PVM** as core runtime modules. It‚Äôs a unified layer built to support future engines like **zk-VMs** or **WASM++**.

## The Developer Experience

Building on **Polkadot Hub** is like setting up a stall in a connected marketplace. Test deployments on Kusama Hub using [Polkadot Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) with faucet tokens. Here‚Äôs how to start:

1. **Deploying to Polkadot Hub**  
   ```bash
   # rEVM path
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polkadotHub
   ```
   ```bash
   # PVM path
   cargo contract build
   cargo contract deploy --network polkadotHub
   ```
   Both use **DOT** for gas, ensuring predictable costs.

2. **Supported Tooling**  
   - **rEVM**: MetaMask, Foundry, Hardhat, Tenderly.  
   - **PVM**: **ink!** CLI, Substrate API Sidecar, polkadot.js.  
   - A [DevContainer](https://x.com/paritytech/status/1978734658108973182) for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts for Polkadot using either Hardhat or Foundry.  
   - VS Code **ink!** extension in progress.

3. **Account Model**  
   - Unified SS58/**EVM**-compatible accounts.  
   - Contracts hold **DOT** and cross-chain assets via **XCM**.

Imagine your app connecting across chains. Here‚Äôs how **Polkadot Hub**‚Äôs **XCM** makes it happen.

## Smart-Contract Interoperability via XCM

**Polkadot Hub**‚Äôs **XCM** support is a universal bridge, enabling contracts to:  
- Send assets to Asset Hub for DOT/USDT transfers.  
- Connect to Bridge Hub for external networks via Snowbridge.  
- Interact with **XCM** v3+ parachains.  

*Flow*: Contract ‚Üí **XCM** message ‚Üí Target parachain ‚Üí Response callback.  

**Example**: A stablecoin contract on **Polkadot Hub** triggers yield farming on Hydration via **XCM**, enabling seamless DeFi. This sets **Polkadot Hub** apart from typical L2 ecosystems. How does it manage costs? Let‚Äôs explore the economics.

## Economics & Gas Model

**Polkadot Hub** ensures affordability:  
- **Gas fees**: Paid in **DOT**, tied to Polkadot‚Äôs staking economy.  
- **Agile coretime**: Pay only for needed compute, unlike **EVM**‚Äôs congestion-based gas.  
- **Smart-contract rent**: Storage pricing by weight and bytes.  
- **Treasury governance**: Sets parameters via **OpenGov**.  

Together, these mechanisms ensure predictable, low-cost operation across workloads.

---

## Security and Governance

**Polkadot Hub**‚Äôs resilience comes from:  
- **Security**: Inherits Polkadot‚Äôs validator security via the relay chain, backed by **rEVM** and **PVM** audits, eliminating individual consensus needs.  
- **Governance**: Forkless upgrades via Polkadot OpenGov.  
- **Rollout**: Kusama Hub beta in Q2 2025, Polkadot mainnet by Q1 2026.

When can you start? Here‚Äôs the timeline.
