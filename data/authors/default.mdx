I'm Wasiu - A passionate software developer with a knack for turning
complex problems into elegant solutions.

I love working on dev tooling, websites, distributed systems and cryptography.

When I'm not immersed in code, you’ll find me sketching out ideas for my next project or
deep diving into the world of cryptography.

I’m always curious, always learning, and always up for a challenge.
